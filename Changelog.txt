v2.1
+ Binary video conversion done using GUI
. repaired the brownian motion experiment sample.
+ Added code in tranformation function to work with floating ref systems.
+ Added a preview Mod for floating ref systems in CoordinateSystem Tool.
.+ Added and corrected code in the sample experiments
.+ Corrected Total frames setting KLT.
.+ removed BinaryTracker, added BOT.

v2.0
>>mega changes to the whole library.
. moved non GUI code under +PhysTrack package
. moved GUIs, and related scripts/functions under GUI directory
. for backwards compatibility. sample experiment names and outcomes are almost similar for the new scripts
+ Video reader 2 introduced.
	> video reader object moved one layer to the bottom. video reader 2 encapsulates the trimming, cropping and binary conversion information.
+ Video reader 2 read2 function added for reading vr2 objects.
+ KLT and binary trackers return similar kinds of objects.
+ KLT TP filtration now done using a GUI.
+ StructOp can be used to operate scalar numbers directly with the trajectories
+ strToArr can convert struct trajectories to arrays and arrToStr can convert them back.
. Video trimming tool include cropping as well.
. Stitching and transformation functions can wor directly withtrajectory structs.
+ user image correction algorithm can be used automatically for pre-processing images. SetPreProcessingFunction() function does that. Some standard functions are aalready available. Like CorrectHSV, medfilt3 and AdjustBrightnessContrast.
+ GetColor can return colors by string names.
+ VidPlot can be used to make colored animated video plots.


V1.2
x Changed vro, fps, ifi, ofi to global variables
+ added support to cache the video in video trimming tool for faster playback of compressed videos. Declare enable enableFastPlayback=true before vidTrimTool to enable fast playback.

V1.1
+ Added analyzeBrownianMotionScript
+ Added blob detection based motion tracking scripts. Supports multiple objects detection at the same time. Objects are detected automatically.
+ Added fileInit2 for bd_1

V1.0
+ Started Changelogs
- Removed background elimination, and its variants. They were named md_1 to md_4.
. Every analyze script requries fileInit to be called first. All sub directories are added automatically.
. Video trimming tool generates local ifi and ofi
