## What is PhysTrack?

PhysTrack is a Matlab based video tracking solution for analyzing kinematics of moving bodies. Since Matlab is a very popular analysis tool in physics laboratories around the globe, we have tried to combine the robustness of Matlab computation power with such a friendly user interface which can be found in commercial video tracking software.

## Who should use it?

PhysTrack is used in numerous physics experiments of [Smart Physics Lab](http://physlab.org/smart-physics/) section of [PhysLab](http://physlab.org/smart-physics/). 

Physics teachers, students and researchers can use PhysTrack to track the motion of moving bodies and investigate the underlying physics in many kinds of experiments. Typical examples of these experiments are rotating and translating discs [1], spring pendulum systems [2], bodies colliding on a plane and projectiles [3], microspheres exhibiting Brownian motion [4], liquid droplets falling down a stream and the movement of a fruitfly [5].

Examples of some experiments can be viewed on the Smart Physics Lab website on [This Link](http://physlab.org/smart-physics/).

## Requirements for performing an experiment with PhysTrack

* In addition to the primary knowledge of kinematics, we assume that the user is accustomed to the basics of Matlab tool and language.

* To capture videos a good slow motion camera is required. In PhysLab, we usually use a [Canon PowerShot SX280HS](https://www.cnet.com/products/canon-powershot-sx280-hs/review/) mounted on a tripod stand which works very well with most of the mechanics experiments. This camera can capture video at as high a frame rate as 240fps with a frame size of 320x240 pixels.

* For investigating microscopic motion, a video microscope is also required. In PhysLab, we usually use a [Motic BA210 Trinocular](http://www.motic.com/As_LifeSciences_UM_BA210/product_240.html) for investigating the Browninan motion of micro particles.

* Usually, to move the objects in required fashion, an apparatus is also recommended.

* A computer with RAM >=3GB and an installation of Matlab 2006 (or above) with [Image Acquisition Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/imaq.html) and [Computer Vision Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html) is also required.

## Performing a physics experiment with PhysTrack

Performing a classical mechanics experiments using video tracking and performing advance analysis is very simple.

* We capture video of the moving object using a digital camera, 
* use one of the automated trackers of PhysTrack to track the objects and generate position and orientation data,
* to investigate the motion, use the in-built Matlab tools or those included in PhysTrack like numerical differentiation, curve fitting, object stitching and coordinate system transformation and
* present the results using Matlab plots and video plots included in PhysTrack.

## Experimental Demonstrations
For demonstration purpose, the we have packed some additional files with PhysTrack. We have also created some sample analysis scripts for different kinds of experiments and provided the videos used with them.
