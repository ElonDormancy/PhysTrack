## What is PhysTrack?

PhysTrack is a Matlab based video tracking solution for analyzing kinematics of moving bodies. Since Matlab is a very popular analysis tool in physics laboratories around the globe, we have tried to combine the robustness of Matlab computation power with such a friendly user interface which can be found in commercial video tracking software.

## Who should use it?

Physics teachers, students and researchers can use PhysTrack in many kinds of experiments. Typical examples of these experiments are rotating and translating discs [1], spring pendulum systems [2], bodies colliding on a plane and projectiles [3], microspheres exhibiting Brownian motion [4], liquid droplets falling down a stream and the movement of a fruitfly [5].
