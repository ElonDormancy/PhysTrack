PhysTrack is a Matlab based video tracking solution for analyzing kinematics of moving bodies. Since Matlab is a very popular analysis tool in physics laboratories around the globe, we have tried to combine the robustness of Matlab computation power with such a friendly user interface which can be found in commercial video tracking software.

A comprehensive documentation of the code can be viewed on PhysTrack Wiki on <a href="https://github.com/umartechboy/PhysTrack/wiki">This Link</a>. 

The whole work is an effort of <a href="http://physlab.org/">PhysLab</a>, <a href="https://lums.edu.pk/">LUMS</a>, Pakistan. Kindly feel free to contact in case you wish to contribute in the development and improvement of this library.
